3. Fill in the task details
4. Click "Save Task"

#### From Google Sheets
1. Go to the Tasks sheet
2. Use the `createTask()` function in Apps Script
3. Or manually add a row (not recommended - use the interface for proper formatting)

#### Using Apps Script Function
```javascript
createTask(
    "Task Title",           // title
    "Task Description",     // description  
    "Project Name",         // project
    "John Doe",            // assignee
    "High",                // priority
    new Date("2024-12-31"), // dueDate
    8                      // estimatedHours
);
```

### Managing Tasks

#### Update Task Status
- Use the web interface action buttons
- Or call `updateTaskStatus(taskId, newStatus)` function
- Or edit directly in the sheet (triggers automatic formatting)
